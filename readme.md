# `linkshort`: a Cloudflare Workers Link Shortener
I followed [this](<https://dev.to/mmascioni/build-a-link-shortener-with-cloudflare-workers-the-back-end-35bd>) tutorial by Matthew Mascioni on [dev.to](https://dev.to).

It is modified such that the endpoint to add a slug to linkshort is not available. I want to control access to this.
